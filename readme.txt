FRAME PERFECT

This is a prototype for a web application called Frame Perfect. It strives
to create a general hitbox/frame data application that can theoretically
support multiple fighting games, although at the moment it focuses mainly on
Super Smash Bros. Melee. Currently the prototype utilizes mainly Canvas
and jQuery UI, but media queries and local storage are core features that we
would like to implement soon. Some other technologies that we may look into
are Heroku and Node.js. We're hoping that this project will be a community effort because there is
a lot of content that needs to be extracted from games.

Even though the class is over, I hope to continue to work on the application
and launch an alpha sometime in 2014. By this time we hopefully will have
all of the technological implementations completed and at least 2 full sets
of characters (most likely Fox and Falco) implemented in the application.
